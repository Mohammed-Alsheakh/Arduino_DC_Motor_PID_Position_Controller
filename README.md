# Arduino DC Motor PID Control

This project demonstrates closed-loop position control of a DC motor using a PID controller on an Arduino. The motor's position is measured using a potentiometer as feedback.

## Features

- PID control of DC motor speed
- sensor options: Potentiometer
- Real-time PWM adjustment based on error

## Tools & Components

- Arduino Uno
- L298N Motor Driver
- Servo motor with control card removed
- Power supply (12V)
- Potentiometer for reference position
